## Ingredients:
* 1 C whole milk
* pinch saffron or saffron extract
* 3 T + 1 t honey, divided
* 1 t dry yeast
* 1 egg + 1 egg yolk, divided
* 1 large navel orange, zest and juice
* 3 T neutral oil
* 1/2 t kosher salt
* 1 1/2 C dried currants
* 3 C all-purpose flour

## Steps:

1. In a pot on medium heat, warm milk with crumbled saffron threads to lukewarm, about 100F.  Remove from heat and whisk in 3 T honey, and yeast.  Set aside for about 5 minutes until yeast is fluffy.
2. Pour milk into bowl and whisk to combine thoroughly with egg, orange zest and juice, oil, and salt.
3. Add currants and flour, and with wet hands knead to form a shaggy dough.  Knead for about 8 minutes, or until dough is elastic.  Form dough into a ball and place in a lightly-oiled bowl.  Cover with plastic wrap and a kitchen towel and let rest in a warm spot for about 40 minutes, or until nearly doubled in size.
4. Grease a 9x5' loaf pan.  Fit dough into prepared loaf pan.  Once again, cover with plastic wrap and kitchen towel and leave in a warm place to rest for about 40 minutes.
5. Preheat oven to 325F.
6. In a small bowl, mix egg yolk and remainder of honey with 1 T water.  Brush mixture over top of risen dough.
7. Bake for 35-40 minutes, until golden.  Let sit in pan for 5 minutes before turning out onto a wire rack to cool completely.  Wait until bread is completely cool before cutting a slice.  For warm bread, reheat or toast after it is completely cooled.
