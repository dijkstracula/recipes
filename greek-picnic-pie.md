## Ingredients

* 3-4 T olive oil
* 1 large eggplant, sliced into rounds
* 1 onion, chopped
* 1 garlic clove, crushed
* 6oz fresh spinach, washed
* 4 eggs
* 3oz feta, crumbled
* 1/2 C grated Parmesan
* 4 T plain yogurt
* 6 T creamy milk
* 2 C cooked white or brown long grain rice
* salt/pepper

Zucchini make a good alternative to eggplants.  Fry them for 3-4 minutes in a little oil, or unti golden.  You will need 3-4 medium sized ones, or, use baby zucchini and thinly slice them horizontally.  They would look particularly attractive on top of the pie.

For the pastry:

* 2 C all-purpose flower
* pinch of salt
* 1 t dried basil
* 1/2 C butter, diced
* 3-4 T chilled water

## Steps

1. To make the pastry, sift the flour and salt into a mixing bowl.  Stir in the basil, then rub or cut the butter until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs.  Sprinkle over most of the water and mix to a dough, adding more water if required.  Wrap in cling film and chill for 30m
2. Roll out the pastry thinly and use to line a 25cm/10' quiche pan.  Cover with cling film amd chill for 30m longer.  Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 350F.
3. Prick around the base of the chilled pastry case all over with a fork and blind bake in the oven for 10-12 minutes, or until the pastry is turning golden.  (If you prefer, bake the pastry lined with parchment and weighted with baking beans.  Remove the paper and beans for the last few minutes of baking.)
4. To make the filling, heat 3 T of the oil in a frying pan and gently fry the eggplant slices for 6-8 minutes on each side, until golden.  Drain on a plate covered with a few layers of kitchen paper.
5. Add the onion and garlic to the oil remaining in the pan and fry over a gentle heat for 4-5 minutes until soft, adding a little extra oil if necessary.
6. Chop the spinach finely.  Beat the eggs in a large mixing bowl.
7. Add the spinach, crumbled feta, Parmesan, yogurt, milk, and the onion imxture to the eggs.  Season well with salt and pepper and stir thoroughly.
8. Spread the cooked rice on an even layer over the base of the pastry.  Reserve 8 of the best eggplant slices and arrange the rest in an even layer over the rice.
9. Spoon the spinach and feta over the eggplants and place the reserved slices on top.  Bake for 30-40 minutes or until lightly browned.  Serve warm or cold, with a mixed salad.
