Tags: baking, brunch

## Ingredients

* 2 cups whole milk
* 2 T honey
* 1 t dry active yeast
* 1 C all-purpose flour
* 1 C dark rye flour
* 1/2 t ground cinnamon
* 1/2 t kosher salt
* 1/2 C melted butter
* 1/4 C powdered sugar
* drizzle of golden syrup

## Steps

1. In a saucepan on medium, heat milk to lukewarm, about 100F.  Whisk in honey and add yeast.  Remove from heat and let rest for 5 minutes, or until yeast froths and appears fluffy.
2. In a large bowl, combine all-purpose and rye flour, cinnamon, and salt.
3. Add milk mixture and melted butter, working gently to just combine.  Do not overwork batter, which will result in tough pancakes.
4. Cover with plastic wrap & a clean kitchen towel, and let rest in a warm spot for 1 hour.
5. Set lightly-greased poffertje pan on medium heat.  (If you can't find a poffertje pan, approximate the shape by dropping small rounds of batter into a frying pan.).  Give batter a quick stir to deflate.  Working in batches, spoon batter into individual poffertje molds and cook for about 2 minutes per side until golden.  Dust with powdered sugar and drizzle with golden syrip before serving.
