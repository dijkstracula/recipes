## Ingredients

* 70ml lemon juice (ie from 2 lemons), plus the skin of 1 lemon shaved off in about 8 thin strips
* 30g unsalted butter
* 400g blanched almonds
* 5g sage leaves, roughly chopped
* 5g rosemary leaves, finely chopped
* 1 tsp maple syrup
* Flaky sea salt
* 2 tsp olive oil
* 1 tsp sumac
* 1Â½ tsp urfa chilli flakes

## Steps

Heat the oven to 150C/300F/gas mark 2. In a small saucepan, reduce the lemon
juice on a high heat for three minutes until only a tablespoon and a half
remains, then tip into a bowl.

Melt the butter in a small saucepan on a high heat, then strain through
a fine-mesh sieve into the lemon syrup bowl (discard the butter solids). Stir
in the almonds, lemon strips, herbs, syrup and a teaspoon and a quarter of
salt, then spread out on a 30cm x 40cm oven tray lined with baking paper.

Roast for 18-20 minutes, stirring from time to time, until the nuts are
golden-brown and the herbs and lemon are crisp. Stir in the oil, sumac and
chilli, roast for three to four minutes, until a deep golden-brown, then leave
to cool before serving.
