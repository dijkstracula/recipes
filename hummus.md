# Hummus

Source: Ottolenghi

* 60 g Tahini Sauce (recipe below)
* 12 confit garlic cloves, plus 4 tbsp Confit Garlic Oil (recipe below)
* 550 g cooked chickpeas (recipe below)
* 180 g to 210 g tahini paste (depending on brand)
* Salt
* 1/4 cup lemon juice
* 5 tbsp plus 2 tsp ice-cold water, plus extra
* 1 1⁄2 tbsp parsley, finely chopped

Make the Tahini Sauce and the Confit Garlic Oil. Set about 100 grams of the
cooked chick- peas aside in a small bowl. Add the remaining chickpeas, tahini
paste, 8 of the confit garlic cloves, 1⁄2 teaspoon salt, and the lemon juice to
the bowl of a food processor and blitz until smooth, 2 to 3 minutes. With the
machine running, slowly drizzle in the ice water until completely smooth and
aerated. You may have to add slightly more water to reach the desired texture.
Taste and adjust for seasoning if necessary. Add the parsley, 2 tablespoons of
Confit Garlic Oil, and a pinch of salt to the bowl with the reserved chickpeas,
and stir to combine. Set aside. Transfer the hummus to a shallow platter and
smooth it out with the back of a spoon, creating a slight well in the center.
(It’s okay if the hummus is a little runny; hummus will set as it cools.)
Spread the Tahini Sauce into the well, then spoon the herbed chickpea mixture
over the top of the tahini. Top the dish with the remaining confit garlic
cloves along with some of the aromatics in the jar (thyme and chili). Finish
with a drizzle of Confit Garlic Oil.

## Chickpea Prep

* 200 g dried chickpeas
* 1 1⁄2 tsp baking soda, divided
* 1 tsp salt

Soak the chickpeas overnight in a large bowl with enough cold water to cover by
several inches, plus 1 teaspoon of baking soda. Drain and refresh, then add to
a large pot with enough water to cover by 2 to 3 inches and the remaining 1⁄2
teaspoon of baking soda. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then lower the
heat to medium, cover with a lid, and cook for at least 30 minutes and up to 60
minutes, skimming the top as necessary, until soft enough to crush between two
fingers. Remove the lid, add the salt, and continue to cook for 15 minutes to
season the chickpeas. Drain and set aside until ready to use.

## Tahini Sauce

* 60 g tahini paste
* 1 1⁄2 tbsp lemon juice
* 1 garlic clove, crushed
* A pinch of salt, or to taste
* 3 tbsp water, plus 1 tsp water, or as needed

Combine all the ingredients except the water in a bowl and whisk to combine.
Slowly add the water while whisking until the mixture is smooth and pourable.
Taste for seasoning and adjust if necessary. Set aside at room temperature if
using soon, or refrigerate in a sealed container if making ahead. Tahini Sauce
keeps in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.

## Confit Garlic Oil

* 12 garlic cloves, peeled 6 thyme sprigs
* 1 green chili
* 200 ml olive oil
* Salt

Combine all ingredients in a small sauce- pan over medium-low heat. Cover and
cook until the garlic is soft and just beginning to color, about 20 to 25
minutes. Leave the lid on, remove from the heat, and set aside for 10 minutes;
the garlic will continue to cook in the heat of the oil. Strain the oil into a
clean glass jar and spoon in the garlic, thyme, and chili. Once cool, transfer
everything to an airtight, sterilized jar and store at room temperature for
several weeks.
