## Ingredients

* 1 T Honey
* 1 t active dry yeast
* 2 C buttermilk
* 1 large navel orange, zest and juice
* 1/2 ground nutmeg
* 1 C dried unsweetened cranberries
* 1/2 C minged candied ginger
* 2 C all-purpose flour
* 1/2 t salt
* 4-6 C canola or neutral oil, for frying
* 1/4 C confectioner's sugar

## Steps

1. In a large mixing bowl, combine 2 T lukewarm water, honey, and yeast.  Let stand for 5 minutes, until yeast begins to foam and look fluffy.
2. Whisk in buttermilk, orange zest and juice, netmug, cranberries, and ginger.  Add flour and salt, and mix to form a shaggy dough - somewhere between a batter and a dough.  Knead as best you can, or mix in a stand mixer with a dough hook for about 6 minutes, or until dough feels stretchy.
3. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and a clean kitchen towel.  Let stand in a warm place until doubled in size, about 1 hour.
4. Fill a large, heavy-bottomed pot with oil.  On high, heat oil to 375F.  Pinch balls of dough directly from mixing bowl and drop into hot oil, a few at a time.  Use caution when working around hot oil!  Move balls and flip with a slotted spoon for even cooking.  Cook for 4-6 minutes, until golden, then remove to a plate lined with paper towels.
5. When all olliebollen are fried, transfer to a serving dish and sprinkle with confectioner's sugar shaken from above through a fine-mesh sieve.
