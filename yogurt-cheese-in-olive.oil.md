## Ingredients

* 1 1/4 cups Greek sheep's yogurt
* 1/2 t salt
* 2 t crushed chillies or chilli powder
* 1 T chopped fresh rosemary
* 1 T chopped fresh thyme or oregano
* approx 1 1/4 cups olive oil (garlic infused if possible)

## Steps

1. Sterilize a 30cm/12in square of muslin cheesecloth by steeping it in boiling water.  Drain and lay over a large plate.  Mix the yogurt with the salt and tip onto the centre of the cheesecloth.
2. Bring up the sides of the muslin and tie firmly with string.  You should now have a secured bag that can be hung.
3. Hang the bag on a kitchen cupboard handle or in a suitable position where it can be suspended with a bowl underneath to catch the whey as it drips.  Leave for 2-3 days or until the whey stops dripping.
4. Wash thoroughly and dry two 450g/1 lb glass preserving jars or jam jars.  Sterilize them by heating them in an over preheated to 300F for 15 minutes.
5. Mix together the chilli and the herbs.  Take spoonfulls of the cheese and roll into balls with your hands.  Lower into the jars, sprinkling each layer with the herb mixture.
6. Pour the olive oil over the soft cheese balls until they are completely covered.  Mix gently with the handle end of a wooden spoon in order to blend the flavourings into the oil, making sure you do not break up the cheese balls.  Store in the refrigerator for up to three weeks.
7. Serve by spooning out of the jars with a bit of the flavoured oil and spread onto lightly-toasted bread.
