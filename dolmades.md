## Ingredients

* 12 fresh vine leaves (preserved or tinned will also work)
* 2 T olive oil
* 1 small onion, chopped
* 2 T pine nuts
* 1 garlic clove, crushed
* 1 C cooked long grain rice
* 2 tomatoes, skinned, seeded, and chopped
* 1 T chopped fresh mint
* 1 lemon, sliced
* 2/3 C dry white wine
* scant 1 C vegetable stock
* salt and pepper
* lemon wedges and mint sprigs to garnish

Note: if using preserved vine leaves, blanch but do not rinse before use.

## Steps

1. Soak clay pot in cold water for 20 minutes then drain.  Blanch the vine leaves in a pan of boiling water for 2 minutes or until they darken and soften.  Rinse the leaves under cold running water and leave to drain.
2. Heat the olive oil in a frying pan, add the onion, and fry for 5-6 minutes, stirring frequently, until softened.  Add the pine nuts and crushed garlic and cook, stirring continuously, until the onions and pine nuts are golden. 
3. Add the onion mixutre into the rice, then add and stir in the chopped tomatoes and fresh mint.  Season to taste with salt and freshly ground black pepper.
4. Place a spoonful of the rice mixture at the stalk end of each vine leaf.  Fold the sides over the filling and roll up tightly.
5. Place the stuffed vine leaves close together, seam side down, in the clay pot.  Place the lemon slices on top and in between the stuffed vine leaves.  Pour over the white wine and sufficient stock just to cover the vine leaves and lemon.
6. Cover and place in an unheated oven.  Set the oven to 400F and cook for 30 minutes.  Reduce to 325F and cook for another 30 minutes.
7. Serve hot or cold and drizzle with fruity olive oil.
