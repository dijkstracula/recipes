## Ingredients
* 2 sweet onions, chopped
* 2-3 lbs fresh spinach (about three large plastic bins' worth)
* 1 lb thawed phyllo dough, ~18 sheets (thaw overnight in fridge or 3-4 hours at room temp)
* 6-8 large eggs
* 2 lbs feta cheese, drained and crumbled
* 4-5 Tbls. romano cheese, grated
* 1-2 sticks butter
* 1/2 tsp. nutmeg
* 3-4 Tbls. dill
* ground pepper to taste
* (1/2 cup toasted pine nuts)
* olive oil

## how 2 make

* Chop the onions and saut√© in olive oil.  Wash and trim the spinach and cook until wilted. 
Let the mixture cool and squeeze out or drain excess moisture.
* Whisk the eggs, cheese, nutmeg, pepper, dill, pine nuts, and spinach/onion mixture in a large bowl. 
* Melt the butter in the microwave, set aside.  
* Grate the romano cheese into the bottom of the bundt pan and arrange evenly.
* Remove the thawed phyllo dough from package.  Quickly separate sheets one at a time and drape on top of bundt pan, poking
a hole into phyllo where centre tube is and push phyllo into pan to line it
* Repeat with another phyllo sheet, but place it perpendicular to the first
* Continue until all are used (8-10 sheets); the edges should hang well over the outer edges of the bundt pan
* Scrape spinach/egg/feta mix into bundt pan and foldge edges of phyllo over the filling
* Using a sharp knife, poke 20-25 holes into the top of dough to reach all the way to the bottom of the pan
* Slowly pour melted butter over the torte, letting the butter seep into the holes and down both sides of the pan (the centre and outer ring)
* Place bundt pan on a baking sheet and bake for 1 hour at 350F
* Allow Spanibundtika to cool for 30-60 minutes before interting onto a plate and slicing
