## Ingredients

* 250ml sunflower oil
* 4 medium onions, thinly sliced
* 250g green or brown lentils
* 2 tsp cumin seeds
* 1½ tbsp coriander seeds
* 200g basmati rice
* 2 tbsp olive oil
* ½ tsp ground turmeric
* 1½ tsp ground allspice
* 1½ tsp ground cinnamon
* 1 tsp sugar
* Salt and black pepper
* 350ml water

## Steps

Heat the sunflower oil in a medium-size heavy-based saucepan. When very hot,
carefully add a third of the sliced onion. Fry for five to seven minutes,
stirring occasionally with a slotted spoon, until the onion takes on a nice,
golden-brown colour and turns crispy. Use the spoon to transfer the onion to
a colander and sprinkle with salt. Repeat with two more batches of onion.

Meanwhile, put the lentils in a small saucepan, cover with plenty of water,
bring to a boil and cook for 12-15 minutes, or until the lentils have softened
but still have a little bite. Drain into a colander.

Wipe clean the saucepan in which you fried the onion and drop in the cumin and
coriander seeds. Place over a medium heat and toast the seeds for a minute or
two, until they release those distinctive aromas. Add the rice, olive oil,
turmeric, allspice, cinnamon, sugar, half a teaspoon of salt and plenty of
black pepper. Stir to coat the rice with oil, then add the cooked lentils and
water. Bring to a boil, cover and simmer on very low heat for 15 minutes.

Remove from the heat, lift off the lid and cover the pan with a clean tea
towel. Seal tightly with the lid and set aside for 10 minutes. Finally, tip the
rice and lentils into a large mixing bowl. Add half the fried onion and stir
gently with a fork. Pile up in a shallow serving bowl and top with the rest of
the onion.
