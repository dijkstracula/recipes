## Steps

1. Preheat oven to 325F.  Grease an 18cm/7in round cake tin.  Cut out a round of baking parchment to fit the cake tin and line it carefully into the corners.
2. Put all the cake ingredients, except the apricots, into a large mixing bowl and whisk until creamy.  Fold the apricots into the cake mixture.
3. Spoon into the tin.  Make a hollow in the centre with the back of a spoon.  Sprinkle 1T of the raw sugar over with the flaked almonds.
4. Bake for 90m or until an inserted skewer comes out clean.  Sprinkle the remaining sugar over and cool for 10 minutes in the tin.  Remove from the tin and cool on a wire rack.
