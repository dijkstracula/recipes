## Ingredients

* 2/3 C olive oil
* 1 large onion, chopped
* 1 3/4 C dried chickpeas, soaked overnight
* 1 T all-purpose flour
* juice of 1 lemon
* 3 T chopped parsley
* salt and ground black pepper

## Steps

1. Heat the oil in a heavy pan, add the onion and saute until it starts to colour.
2. Meanwhile, drain the chickpeas, rinse them udner cold water, and drain them again.  Shake the colander to dry as much as possible, then add them to the plan.  Turn them with a spatula for a few minutes to coat them well in the oiil, then pour enough hot water to cover them by about 4cm/1 1/2 inches.
3. Slowly bring to a boil.  Skim off any froth that rises to the surface and discard.  Lower to a simmer.  Add some pepper, cover, and cook for 1-1 1/4 hours, or until the chickpeas are soft.
4. Put the flour in a cup and stir in lemon juice with a fork.  When the chickpeas are perfectly sfot, add this mixture to them.  Mix well, then add salt and pepper to taste.  Cover and cook for 5-10m more.
5. To thicken, take out two cupfuls of the chickpeas and blend so that the chickpeas are broken up but remain rough.  Stir into the soup and mix well.
6. Add parsley.  Taste and add more lemon juice if bland.  Serve in heated bowls and offer extra olive oil at the table.
