# Red wine braised cabbage

Tags: holiday, side dish

Source: April

## Ingredients

* 1 red cabbage
* 4 T butter, divided
* 2 shallots, halved lengthwise
* 2 C peeled, cored, grated tart green apples (Granny Smith)
* 1 C red wine, such as Merlot
* 1/4 C brown sugar
* 1/2 t kosher salt
* 1/2 t ground black pepper
* 1 bay leaf
* 1 cinnamon stick
* 1 T apple cider vinegar

## Steps

1. Remove any damaged outer leaves from the Cabbage, then halve lengthwise.  Cut in half again lengthwise, then cut core from each wedge.  Slice each quarter horizontally into thin ribbons.  Set aside.
2. In a large, heavy-bottomed pot on medium-high heat, melt 2 T butter.  Add shallots, and cook for 2 minutes.  Place grated apples and chopped cabbage into pot and, as best you can, stir to coat.  I find that a pair of long tongs works best for this.
3. Add wine, brown sugar, salt, pepper, bay leaf, and cinnamon stick, and stir to combine.  Cover, reduce heat to medium, and cook, removing lid occasionally to stir, for about 20 minutes.
4. Remove lid, and cook until liquid has mostly dissipated, another 4-6 minutes.
5. Add 2 T butter and 1 T vinegar, and stir to coat. Cabbage should appear glossy and be soft with a residual bit of crunch.  Discard bay leaf and cinnamon stick before serving.
