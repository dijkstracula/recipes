## Ingredients

* 3 medium to large eggplants
* 14oz feta
* a bunch of fresh coriander, roughly chopped, plus extra sprigs for garnish
* 4 T olive oil
* salt and pepper

## Steps

1. Prepare a barbeque.  Cook the aubergines for around 20 minutes, turning occasionally, until they are slightly charred and soft.  Remove and cut in half lengthways.
2. Carefully scoop the aubergine flesh into a bowl, reserving skins.  Mash the flesh roughly with a fork.
3. Crumble the feta, and then stir into the mashed aubergine with the chopped coriander and olive oil.  Season with salt and pepper to taste.
4. Spoon the mixture back into the skins and return to the BBQ for 5 minutes to warm through.
5. Serve immediately with a fresh green salad, coated with fruity olive iol and garnished with sprigs of coriander.
